# MPM ERD Visio File Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the Visio file. The actual ERD is generated from the PlantUML source file (mpm-erd.puml).

To create a Visio file:
1. Open Microsoft Visio
2. Import the mpm-erd.png image as a reference
3. Use the Database Model Diagram template
4. Recreate the entities and relationships based on the PlantUML source

The PlantUML source provides all the entity definitions, relationships, and indexing information needed to create the Visio diagram.

Note: PlantUML is the source of truth for the ERD definition.
